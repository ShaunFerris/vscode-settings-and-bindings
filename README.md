# vscode-settings-and-bindings
A backup of my settings.json and keybindings.json files for vscode. Contains keybindings and settings for vscode vim in particular. To use all my settings you can simply replace your existing settings files with these, but I reccommend using these more as a reference for bindings that you might like to add when using the vscode vim extension.
